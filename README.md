This repository contains the code based on Theano for the paper:

"Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Multi-Frame Super-Resolution." Huang, Yan and Wang, Wei and Wang, Liang
Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28.

## dataset

dataset is generated as (.mat) form by using the matlab code(`src/yuv2png.m` and 'src/process_data.m').
---
The code is used for owner private experiment, which the result lower performance than its mentioned in original paper, as a reference.
